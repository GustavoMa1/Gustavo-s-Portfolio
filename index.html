 <!--Summary for my Portfolio-->
<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
<p>
  Iâ€™m <strong>Gustavo M. A. Moreira</strong>, a 22-year-old <strong>Software Engineering student</strong> and 
  <strong>IT freelancer</strong>, living in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
  I enjoy working with <strong>technology, web development</strong>, and creative projects like 
  <strong>photography and design</strong>.<br>
  My professional journey is diverse: I have worked in a <strong>library, shopping centre, game shops, 
  telemarketing, and supermarkets</strong>, gaining strong skills in customer service, organisation, 
  and teamwork.<br>
  Here in Ireland, I also work in <strong>cleaning services</strong> and support <strong>private clients in 
  the health care sector</strong>, which taught me responsibility, discipline, and adaptability in 
  different environments.<br>
  Right now, my main focus is to grow in the <strong>Web Development field</strong>, combining my studies 
  with creativity and problem-solving. I continue freelancing in IT support and exploring 
  <strong>photography</strong> as a creative outlet.<br>
  This portfolio is where I share my <strong>journey, skills, and projects</strong> as I keep learning, 
  growing, and creating solutions that make a difference.<br>
