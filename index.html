 <p>Gustavo M.A Moreira <br /> <!--Summary for my Portfolio-->
  I’m a Software Engineering student and IT freelancer, living in Dublin, Ireland.<br>
  I enjoy working with technology, web development, and creative projects like photography and design.<br>
  </p> 
  Alongside my studies, I also work in cleaning services and I am open to opportunities in the health care sector.<br>
  These experiences help me stay organised, responsible, and adaptable to different kinds of work environments.<br>
  This portfolio is where I share my journey, skills, and the projects I’ve been working on.<br>
   My goal is to keep learning, growing, and creating solutions that make a difference.<br>
