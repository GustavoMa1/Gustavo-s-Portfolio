    <p>Hello, my name is Gustavo M. A. Moreira. I’m 22 years old, originally from Brazil, and currently living in Dublin, Ireland. <br>
        My journey has been shaped by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to keep learning every single day.<br>
        I’m studying Software Engineering (Estácio, 2023–in progress) and building my career in Technology and IT.<br>
        Back in Brazil, I worked as a freelancer in IT support, and I still help clients remotely with tech solutions.<br>
        I’ve also worked in customer service and retail, which taught me how to stay organised, communicate with people from different backgrounds, and solve problems quickly.<br>
        At the moment, I’m focused on improving my English (currently A2–B1 level), exploring new opportunities in Ireland, and developing my skills in web development, photography, and technology.<br>
        I enjoy working with people, asking questions, and learning hands-on—whether it’s coding a website, supporting a customer, or exploring a new creative idea.<br>
        Beyond work and study, I’m passionate about music, anime, photography, films, and games. I believe freedom, originality, and authenticity are essential in everything I do.<br>
        For me, life is about constant growth, self-discovery, and creating my own path.<br>
        This website is part of that journey—a place where I share my projects, ideas, and what inspires me.
