    <p>I’m Gustavo, 22 years old, from Brazil and now living in Dublin, Ireland. <br>
    I’m a English student and also work as a freelancer in IT support, helping clients with technology solutions both locally and remotely.<br>
    My professional journey is diverse. In Brazil, I worked in a library, shopping centre, game shops, telemarketing, and supermarkets, gaining strong skills in customer service, organisation, and teamwork.<br> 
    Here in Ireland, I have also been working in cleaning services and with private clients in the health care sector, which has helped me build responsibility, discipline, and adaptability in different work environments.<br>
    Right now, my main focus is to grow in the Web Development field, where I combine my technical studies with my passion for creativity and problem-solving.<br>
    I’m also developing myself in photography as a creative outlet.
    This portfolio is a space where I share my projects, skills, and experiences as I continue building my career in Ireland.
