<body>
    <p>Hello, my name is Gustavo M. A. Moreira, I’m 22 years old, originally from Brazil and now living in Dublin, Ireland.<br> 
        I am currently an English student and a Software Engineering student.<br>
        Alongside my studies, I also work as an IT freelancer, supporting clients with technology solutions both remotely and locally.<br>
        I have a wide range of professional experience.
    </p>
        
    <p>In Brazil, I worked in a library, shopping centre, game shops, telemarketing, supermarkets, food sales, bars, and as a waiter, as well as in construction and house building.<br>
        These jobs gave me strong skills in customer service, teamwork, organisation, and problem-solving.<br>
        Here in Ireland,I continue expanding my skills by working in cleaning services and with private clients in the health care sector.<br>
        I also worked two jobs at the same time — in the morning and afternoon at Bubble Mix and during the night in a bar - to save money and support my life in Ireland.<br>
        These experiences taught me resilience, responsibility, and how to adapt quickly to different environments.</p>
        Today, my main career focus is in Web Development, where I combine my technical studies with creativity and problem-solving.<br>
        I’m also passionate about photography and design, which allow me to explore the creative side of technology.<br>
        I see myself as curious, motivated, and eager to learn. I enjoy working with people, asking questions, and growing through every challenge.<br>
        This portfolio is a reflection of my journey, mixing technology, creativity, and real-life experience as I continue building my path in Ireland.
